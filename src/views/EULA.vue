    <p>Apps
    made available through the App Store are licensed, not sold, to you. Your
    license to each App is subject to your prior acceptance of either this Licensed
    Application End User License Agreement ("Standard EULA"), or a custom end user
    license agreement between you and the Application Provider ("Custom EULA"), if
    one is provided. Your license to any Apple App under this Standard EULA or
    Custom EULA is granted by Apple, and your license to any Third Party App under
    this Standard EULA or Custom EULA is granted by the Application Provider of
    that Third Party App. Any App that is subject to this Standard EULA is referred
    to herein as the "Licensed Application." The Application Provider or Apple as
    applicable ("Licensor") reserves all rights in and to the Licensed Application
    not expressly granted to you under this Standard EULA.</p>

    <p>a.
    Scope of License: Licensor grants to you a nontransferable license to use the
    Licensed Application on any Apple-branded products that you own or control and
    as permitted by the Usage Rules. The terms of this Standard EULA will govern
    any content, materials, or services accessible from or purchased within the
    Licensed Application as well as upgrades provided by Licensor that replace or
    supplement the original Licensed Application, unless such upgrade is
    accompanied by a Custom EULA. Except as provided in the Usage Rules, you may
    not distribute or make the Licensed Application available over a network where
    it could be used by multiple devices at the same time. You may not transfer, redistribute
    or sublicense the Licensed Application and, if you sell your Apple Device to a
    third party, you must remove the Licensed Application from the Apple Device
    before doing so. You may not copy (except as permitted by this license and the
    Usage Rules), reverse-engineer, disassemble, attempt to derive the source code
    of, modify, or create derivative works of the Licensed Application, any
    updates, or any part thereof (except as and only to the extent that any
    foregoing restriction is prohibited by applicable law or to the extent as may
    be permitted by the licensing terms governing use of any open-sourced
    components included with the Licensed Application).</p>

    <p>b.
    Consent to Use of Data: You agree that Licensor may collect and use technical
    data and related information including but not limited to technical information
    about your device, system and application software, and peripherals that is
    gathered periodically to facilitate the provision of software updates, product
    support, and other services to you (if any) related to the Licensed
    Application. Licensor may use this information, as long as it is in a form that
    does not personally identify you, to improve its products or to provide
    services or technologies to you.</p>

    <p>c.
    Termination. This Standard EULA is effective until terminated by you or
    Licensor. Your rights under this Standard EULA will terminate automatically if
    you fail to comply with any of its terms.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>d.
    External Services. The Licensed Application may enable access to Licensor's
    and/or third-party services and websites (collectively and individually,
    &quot;External Services&quot;). You agree to use the External Services at your
    sole risk. Licensor is not responsible for examining or evaluating the content
    or accuracy of any third-party External Services, and shall not be liable for
    any such third-party External Services. Data displayed by any Licensed
    Application or External Service, including but not limited to financial,
    medical and location information, is for general informational purposes only
    and is not guaranteed by Licensor or its agents. You will not use the External
    Services in any manner that is inconsistent with the terms of this Standard
    EULA or that infringes the intellectual property rights of Licensor or any
    third party. You agree not to use the External Services to harass, abuse,
    stalk, threaten or defame any person or entity, and that Licensor is not
    responsible for any such use. External Services may not be available in all
    languages or in your Home Country, and may not be appropriate or available for
    use in any particular location. To the extent you choose to use such External
    Services, you are solely responsible for compliance with any applicable laws.
    Licensor reserves the right to change, suspend, remove, disable or impose
    access restrictions or limits on any External Services at any time without
    notice or liability to you.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>e. No
    Warranty: You expressly acknowledge and agree that the use of the licensed
    application is at your sole risk. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable
    law, the licensed application and any services performed or provided by the
    licensed application are provided "as is" and "as available" with all faults
    and without warranty of any kind, and licensor hereby disclaims all warranties
    and conditions with respect to the licensed application and any services either
    express, implied or statutory, including, but not limited to, the implied
    warranties and/or conditions of merchantability of the satisfactory quality, of
    fitness for a particular purpose, of accuracy, of quiet enjoyment, and of
    noninfringement of third-party rights. No oral or written information or advice
    given by licensor or its authorized representatives shall create a warranty.
    Should the licensed application or services prove defective, you assume the
    entire cost of all necessary servicing, repair or correction. Some
    jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties or limitations
    on applicable statutory rights of a consumer, so the above exclusion and
    limitations may not apply to you. </p>

    <p>f.
    Limitation of Liability. To the extent not prohibited by law, in no event shall
    licensor be liable for personal injury or any incidental, special, indirect, or
    consequential damages whatsoever, including, without limitation, damages for
    loss of profits, loss of data, business interruption, or any other commercial
    damages or losses, arising out of or related to your use of or inability to use
    the licensed application, however caused, regardless of the theory of liability
    (contract, tort or otherwise) and even if licensor has been advised of the
    possibility of such damages. Some jurisdictions do not allow the limitation of
    liability for personal injury, or of incidental or consequential damages, so
    this limitation may not apply to you. In no event shall Licensor's total
    liability to you for all damages (other than as may be required by applicable
    law in cases involving personal injury) exceed the amount of fifty dollars
    ($50.00). The foregoing limitations will apply even if the above stated remedy
    fails of its essential purpose.</p>

    <p>g.
    You may not use or otherwise export or re-export the Licensed Application
    except as authorized by United States law and the laws of the jurisdiction in
    which the Licensed Application was obtained. In particular, but without
    limitation, the Licensed Application may not be exported or re-exported (a)
    into any U.S.-embargoed countries or (b) to anyone on the U.S. Treasury
    Department's Specially Designated Nationals List or the U.S. Department of
    Commerce Denied Persons List or Entity List. By using the Licensed Application,
    you represent and warrant that you are not located in any such country or on
    any such list. You also agree that you will not use these products for any
    purposes prohibited by United States law, including, without limitation, the
    development, design, manufacture, or production of nuclear, missile, or
    chemical or biological weapons.</p>

    <p>h.
    The Licensed Application and related documentation are &quot;Commercial
    Items&quot;, as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R. 2.101, consisting of
    &quot;Commercial Computer Software&quot; and &quot;Commercial Computer Software
    Documentation&quot;, as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 or 48 C.F.R.
    227.7202, as applicable. Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 or 48 C.F.R.
    227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4, as applicable, the Commercial Computer Software
    and Commercial Computer Software Documentation are being licensed to U.S.
    Government end users (a) only as Commercial Items and (b) with only those
    rights as are granted to all other end users pursuant to the terms and
    conditions herein. Unpublished-rights reserved under the copyright laws of the
    United States.</p>

    <p>i.
    Except to the extent expressly provided in the following paragraph, this
    Agreement and the relationship between you and Apple shall be governed by the
    laws of the State of California, excluding its conflicts of law provisions. You
    and Apple agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the
    courts located within the county of Santa Clara, California, to resolve any
    dispute or claim arising from this Agreement. If (a) you are not a U.S.
    citizen; (b) you do not reside in the U.S.; (c) you are not accessing the
    Service from the U.S.; and (d) you are a citizen of one of the countries
    identified below, you hereby agree that any dispute or claim arising from this
    Agreement shall be governed by the applicable law set forth below, without
    regard to any conflict of law provisions, and you hereby irrevocably submit to
    the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located in the state, province or
    country identified below whose law governs:</p>

    <p>If
    you are a citizen of any European Union country or Switzerland, Norway or
    Iceland, the governing law and forum shall be the laws and courts of your usual
    place of residence.</p>

    <p>Specifically
    excluded from application to this Agreement is that law known as the United
    Nations Convention on the International Sale of Goods.</p>
