<p>Apps
made available through the App Store are licensed, not sold, to you. Your
license to each App is subject to your prior acceptance of either this Licensed
Application End User License Agreement ("Standard EULA"), or a custom end user
license agreement between you and the Application Provider ("Custom EULA"), if
one is provided. Your license to any Apple App under this Standard EULA or
Custom EULA is granted by Apple, and your license to any Third Party App under
this Standard EULA or Custom EULA is granted by the Application Provider of
that Third Party App. Any App that is subject to this Standard EULA is referred
to herein as the "Licensed Application." The Application Provider or Apple as
applicable ("Licensor") reserves all rights in and to the Licensed Application
not expressly granted to you under this Standard EULA.</p>

<p>a.
Scope of License: Licensor grants to you a nontransferable license to use the
Licensed Application on any Apple-branded products that you own or control and
as permitted by the Usage Rules. The terms of this Standard EULA will govern
any content, materials, or services accessible from or purchased within the
Licensed Application as well as upgrades provided by Licensor that replace or
supplement the original Licensed Application, unless such upgrade is
accompanied by a Custom EULA. Except as provided in the Usage Rules, you may
not distribute or make the Licensed Application available over a network where
it could be used by multiple devices at the same time. You may not transfer, redistribute
or sublicense the Licensed Application and, if you sell your Apple Device to a
third party, you must remove the Licensed Application from the Apple Device
before doing so. You may not copy (except as permitted by this license and the
Usage Rules), reverse-engineer, disassemble, attempt to derive the source code
of, modify, or create derivative works of the Licensed Application, any
updates, or any part thereof (except as and only to the extent that any
foregoing restriction is prohibited by applicable law or to the extent as may
be permitted by the licensing terms governing use of any open-sourced
components included with the Licensed Application).</p>

<p>b.
Consent to Use of Data: You agree that Licensor may collect and use technical
data and related information including but not limited to technical information
about your device, system and application software, and peripherals that is
gathered periodically to facilitate the provision of software updates, product
support, and other services to you (if any) related to the Licensed
Application. Licensor may use this information, as long as it is in a form that
does not personally identify you, to improve its products or to provide
services or technologies to you.</p>

<p>c.
Termination. This Standard EULA is effective until terminated by you or
Licensor. Your rights under this Standard EULA will terminate automatically if
you fail to comply with any of its terms.&nbsp;</p>

<p>d.
External Services. The Licensed Application may enable access to Licensor's
and/or third-party services and websites (collectively and individually,
&quot;External Services&quot;). You agree to use the External Services at your
sole risk. Licensor is not responsible for examining or evaluating the content
or accuracy of any third-party External Services, and shall not be liable for
any such third-party External Services. Data displayed by any Licensed
Application or External Service, including but not limited to financial,
medical and location information, is for general informational purposes only
and is not guaranteed by Licensor or its agents. You will not use the External
Services in any manner that is inconsistent with the terms of this Standard
EULA or that infringes the intellectual property rights of Licensor or any
third party. You agree not to use the External Services to harass, abuse,
stalk, threaten or defame any person or entity, and that Licensor is not
responsible for any such use. External Services may not be available in all
languages or in your Home Country, and may not be appropriate or available for
use in any particular location. To the extent you choose to use such External
Services, you are solely responsible for compliance with any applicable laws.
Licensor reserves the right to change, suspend, remove, disable or impose
access restrictions or limits on any External Services at any time without
notice or liability to you.&nbsp;</p>

<p>e. No
Warranty: You expressly acknowledge and agree that the use of the licensed
application is at your sole risk. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable
law, the licensed application and any services performed or provided by the
licensed application are provided "as is" and "as available" with all faults
and without warranty of any kind, and licensor hereby disclaims all warranties
and conditions with respect to the licensed application and any services either
express, implied or statutory, including, but not limited to, the implied
warranties and/or conditions of merchantability of the satisfactory quality, of
fitness for a particular purpose, of accuracy, of quiet enjoyment, and of
noninfringement of third-party rights. No oral or written information or advice
given by licensor or its authorized representatives shall create a warranty.
Should the licensed application or services prove defective, you assume the
entire cost of all necessary servicing, repair or correction. Some
jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties or limitations
on applicable statutory rights of a consumer, so the above exclusion and
limitations may not apply to you. </p>

<p>f.
Limitation of Liability. To the extent not prohibited by law, in no event shall
licensor be liable for personal injury or any incidental, special, indirect, or
consequential damages whatsoever, including, without limitation, damages for
loss of profits, loss of data, business interruption, or any other commercial
damages or losses, arising out of or related to your use of or inability to use
the licensed application, however caused, regardless of the theory of liability
(contract, tort or otherwise) and even if licensor has been advised of the
possibility of such damages. Some jurisdictions do not allow the limitation of
liability for personal injury, or of incidental or consequential damages, so
this limitation may not apply to you. In no event shall Licensor's total
liability to you for all damages (other than as may be required by applicable
law in cases involving personal injury) exceed the amount of fifty dollars
($50.00). The foregoing limitations will apply even if the above stated remedy
fails of its essential purpose.</p>

<p>g.
You may not use or otherwise export or re-export the Licensed Application
except as authorized by United States law and the laws of the jurisdiction in
which the Licensed Application was obtained. In particular, but without
limitation, the Licensed Application may not be exported or re-exported (a)
into any U.S.-embargoed countries or (b) to anyone on the U.S. Treasury
Department's Specially Designated Nationals List or the U.S. Department of
Commerce Denied Persons List or Entity List. By using the Licensed Application,
you represent and warrant that you are not located in any such country or on
any such list. You also agree that you will not use these products for any
purposes prohibited by United States law, including, without limitation, the
development, design, manufacture, or production of nuclear, missile, or
chemical or biological weapons.</p>

<p>h.
The Licensed Application and related documentation are &quot;Commercial
Items&quot;, as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R. 2.101, consisting of
&quot;Commercial Computer Software&quot; and &quot;Commercial Computer Software
Documentation&quot;, as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 or 48 C.F.R.
227.7202, as applicable. Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 or 48 C.F.R.
227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4, as applicable, the Commercial Computer Software
and Commercial Computer Software Documentation are being licensed to U.S.
Government end users (a) only as Commercial Items and (b) with only those
rights as are granted to all other end users pursuant to the terms and
conditions herein. Unpublished-rights reserved under the copyright laws of the
United States.</p>

<p>i.

Agreement and the relationship between you and Apple shall be governed by the
laws of the State of California, excluding its conflicts of law provisions. You
and Apple agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the
courts located within the county of Santa Clara, California, to resolve any
dispute or claim arising from this Agreement. If (a) you are not a U.S.
citizen; (b) you do not reside in the U.S.; (c) you are not accessing the
